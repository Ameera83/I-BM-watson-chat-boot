# I-BM-watson-chat-boot
Task 3: Create a chat bot through the IBM Watson website and we called it (Sarona) and we created an intent to speak, and the dialogue was about booking an appointment, also the chat bot was trained on different responses and we downloaded the code and then added it to both interfaces for the first time (the control interface) with the robot) and also the second task (interface to the robot control base) we combined the Jason code and added screenshots of the interface
